# Rubiks-Cube-Simulation
A 3D simulation software for modeling a Rubik's Cube. Used Processing & Java for developing the graphical interface and model respectively. The model is created by rendering individual cuboids in 3D space. The cuboids themselves are formed from 6 planes(xy, yz, etc.) that denote a side based on their color. Users can choose to manually control the model or submit an algorithm to execute. Specifically, keyboard input's can be used to directly control the sides of the cube. To control the camera, users can simply move the mouse cursor around to change the position of the camera. The program also gives users the option to simulate an algorithm of any length in real time.


An algorithm  of 1350 moves was applied to the model and scrambled the state of the Rubik's Cube. The entire 1350 rotations were completed in under 25 seconds and is shown below:
